This release updates Omnibear to the latest browser extension APIs as required by Google Chrome. This involved a large refactor

Some additional improvments include:

- Show badge when webmention support is found on a page
- Added a clear draft button (fixes Add "clear draft" button #88)
- Tags are comma separated to support multi-word tags (fixes space separated tags not working with multi-word tags #76)
- Micropub improvements by switching libraries
