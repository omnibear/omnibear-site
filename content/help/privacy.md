Omnibear is a browser extension designed to help you interact with your IndieWeb site. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your data. Below is an overview of our privacy practices:

<!--more-->

## Data Collection and Storage

- **No Data Upload:** Omnibear does **not** upload, transmit, or share any of your data to external servers. All data is stored locally in your browser.
- **Local Storage:** Any information you enter, such as drafts or settings, is saved only in your browser's local storage and is never sent to the developers or any third party.

## Authentication

- **Site Login:** To use Omnibear, you must log in with your own website's authentication. This is required to enable posting and interacting with your site.
- **Credentials:** Your authentication credentials are stored locally and are only used to communicate directly with your site as needed for IndieWeb functionality.

## Webmention Endpoint Detection

- **Page Scanning:** Omnibear includes a script that checks each page you visit for a webmention endpoint. This process happens entirely within your browser and does not transmit any information about the pages you visit to any external service.

## No Tracking or Analytics

- Omnibear does not include any tracking, analytics, or advertising scripts.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted to this page.

## Contact

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please open a discussion on the [Omnibear GitHub repository](https://github.com/omnibear/omnibear/discussions).
