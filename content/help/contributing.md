Omnibear is an Open Source project and welcomes contributions.

<!--more-->

## How to contribute

Some of the ways you could help include:

- Try out the extension/give feedback
- Improve the website/add documentation
- Review open issues/help with maintenance
- Open a PR/make an improvement
- Work on an upstream project/share the love

### Give Feedback

If you have a site with a Micropub endpoint, login and try using Omnibear with your site.
Testing against multiple Micropub servers will help ensure better compatibility.
If you don't have a Micropub endpoint, you can try omnibear with a site like [commentpara.de](https://commentpara.de/) which will let you create a temporary user for posting replies (notes and bookmarks are not supported).

Any feedback about how easy the extension is to use is also welcome.
If something is confusing or could be improved, share your idea.
There are multiple [contact](contact) methods available to reach out.

### Add Documentation

This website is Omnibear's main documentation.
It is a static site build with Hugo hosted in the [omnibear-site](https://github.com/omnibear/omnibear-site) GitHub repository.
If you are great with words or have a good understanding of IndieWeb protocols you could make Omnibear more accessible for others.
There's a specific [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/omnibear/omnibear-site/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for the website if you are interested.

### Help with Maintenance

If you are active on GitHub, consider reviewing open issues.
Identifying duplicate issues helps clarify what work is needed.
It's also helpful to check if you can reproduce a problem someone else reported.
In particular, see the [Need help reproducing](https://github.com/omnibear/omnibear/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Aneed-help-reproducing) label.
If you can reproduce the problem, leave a comment describing how you reproduced it.
If you can't, leave a comment describing what you tried so I can better decide if the issue should be closed.

### Make an Improvement

Interested in trying out browser extension development?
You can learn more about the development process in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/omnibear/omnibear/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file in the Omnibear repository.
While nearly all issues could be potential contributions, see the [Help wanted](https://github.com/omnibear/omnibear/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22) issue label for a list of suggested items.

### Share the Love

Omnibear is dependent on many other projects.
Those projects may need updates to support features in Omnibear.
There could be newer standards or standard extensions that would be helpful to add.
Consider checking out the issues on those projects to see if they could use contributions.

Note that those projects have not signed on to the hackathon and may take longer to respond to issues.
But if you've contributed to these projects before or use them yourself, this might be a unique way to contribute to the broader community while also potentially helping the Omnibear project.
The two most IndieWeb-relevant dependencies are:

- [microformats-parser](https://github.com/microformats/microformats-parser)
- [micropub-helper](https://github.com/grantcodes/micropub)
